4. fun facts 
+ 0: Zero is neither positive nor negative
+ {} - empty set is either even number or odd number
+ set vs sequence: 
  + common: elements, terms 
  + difference  
    + sequence: the same elements can appear multiple times
    + sequence: the order does matter
    + set: the same elements cannot appear multiple times 
    + set: the order doesn't matter

  + No 
  + Yes 
  + It does not matter
